	<br>

	<h2>Week 13</h2>
	<p>More playtests, feedback was that the level 2's overworld style wasn't translating properly and diary entries would crash the game on completion.</p>
	<br>

	<h2>Week 12</h2>
	<p>More bugfixes, changed window size from 1024x768 to 1800x900.</p>
	<br>

	<h2>Week 9</h2>
	<p>Initial playtesters stated that the space was interesting, but more could be done to reflect the setting of the story. They liked the aesthetics, but thought some of the assets were confusing or did not represent what they were supposed to. Those assets have been replaced (like the owl) and various bugs that popped up during playtests were fixed (Going through level 2's walls). More characters, bugfixes, and dialogue cretaed.</p>

	<h2>Week 8</h2>
	<p>Expanded Level 1 to completion</p>

	<br>

	<h2>Week 2</h2>
	<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/amy_green_a_video_game_to_cope_with_grief#t-622714">TED Talk Link</a>
	<p>The talk above is by a writer for That Dragon, Cancer, who was inspired to created the game after the death of her young son to the disease. I want to create a game that can touch upon emotions like this, and although the talk doesn't go much into the technical production behind the game, I could feel the emotion behind it and what kind of vision Green wanted for it.</p>

	<p>Games for social change has always been in a weird spot in the industry because like Green said, people don't really want to go into them knowing that it will be a difficult experience. However, I feel that mainstream games can borrow themes from these types of games and build narrative in them that's separate from the main attraction of the game. A lot of my favorite narrative experiences in games were multi-layered in that each aspect of a game's story can be accessed if the player chooses to do so, but not entirely necessary to progress. This way, players can get more out of a game if they choose to do so while others don't have to sit through a lot of exposition. The question this raises for my work is how can II go about doing this in a meaningful way?</p>

	<h2>Week 1</h2>
	<p>Initial brainstorming stage. Drew out some level designs and scripted some character dialogue on paper, installed Gamemaker Studio on laptop</p>
